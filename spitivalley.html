This area can be visited only by those who have tough leg muscles and strong lungs. The area is closed to foreign visitors.

  <br><br>
    <b>Ki (Kye, Kee) Monastery (4,116 m) :</b> 12 km from Kaza, the Ki Monastery lies high above the left bank of the river Spiti. It is a collection of rooms and a labyrinth of corridors that do not follow any defined plan, but seem to have grown over the years. Portions of the structure are three stories high, while other are lower. No definite date can be ascribed to the construction of the Gompa -that acted both as monastery and as a fort. Some scholars believe this to have been built by Dromton (1008 - 64 AD).
  <br><br>
    <b>Giu Village:</b> Located near the Indo-Tibet border, the village has a naturally preserved unique Mummy, which is more than 500 years old and is an attraction for the visitors. The mummy in the village is placed in a room constructed on a hilltop. It is believed that this mummy is of a Lama, who died at the age of around 45 years and was found in a sitting posture. Giu is situated at a height of approx. 10,000 feet above the sea level. Giu village is approximately 10 Km from Giu nallah and village is connected with link road. Giu nallah is between Sumdo and Tabo.
  <br><br>
    <b>Keylong- Keylong (3,340 m):</b> is the district Headquarters of Lahaul Spiti on the main road to Leh over Rohtang. It is an oasis of green fields and willow trees, water streams surrounded with brown hills and snow capped peaks.
  <br><br>
    <b>Chander Tal :</b> At an altitude of 4,300 metres and 6 Km from the Kunzum Pass in Lahaul & Spiti district that connects Spiti Chander Tal Lake and Lahaul areas. Surrounded by snows and acres of scree, this deep blue-water lake has a circumference of 2.5 Km. This is the source of the river Chandra.
  <br><br>
    <b>Losar :</b>It is situated near the confluence of Losar and Peeno streams at height of 4080 m above sea level. This village is worth a visit being the first big village and because of its Location.
  <br><br>
    <b>Tabo (50 km from Kaza, 3050 m) :</b> At first glance, Tabo seems nothing more than a cluster of large mud huts. But inside, a series of amazing galleries of wall paintings and stucco statues emerge. Founded in 996 AD, it is often called the 'Ajanta of the Himalaya', after the almost legendary art-treasure site in Maharashtra. In terms of area, this is the largest monastic complex in Spiti and the old section has nine temples, 23 chortens, a monks' chamber and a nuns' chamber. There are several caves and contemporary structures that form a part of the Tabo complex. In Trans Himalayan Buddhism, Tabo's sanctity is next only to Tibet's Tholing monastery.
  <br><br>
    <b>Kunzum Pass :</b>Kunzum pass (4,590 m) is the gateway to Spiti from Kullu & Lahaul. After crossing Rohtang pass and driving 20Km, one has to turn right from Gramphoo. While going to this pass, the panoramic view of Bara-Sigri glacier (second longest glacier in the world) is enthralling and inspiring. On one side is the Spiti valley and to the other are numerous C.B. (Chandra-Bhaga) range peaks.
  <br><br>
    <b>Kibber (4,205 m):</b> Located 8 Km away from Ki Village, till recently Kibber was the highest permanently inhabited village of the region connected by a motorable road. It also acts as the base for several high altitude treks. The Kibber Sanctuary that lies past the village has blue sheep and ibex and covers an area of 1,400 square kilometers.
  <br><br>
    <b>Dhankar (3,370 m) :</b> Driving between Tabo and Kaza, on a side road lies the monastery of Dhankar. In local parlance, a 'Dhankar’ is a fort - and that is what this monastery once was. Perched high over the valley, this is a superb example of Spiti's traditional architectural skills. This was once the castle of the ruler of Spiti, the Nono - and today, Dhankar is a repository of Buddhist scriptures in the Bhoti script. Above the monastery lies the Dhankar lake.
  <br><br>
    <b>Kaza (3,660 m) :</b> This is the administrative headquarters of Spiti. It has a marketplace, medical facilities, a filling station, 'rest houses' and hotels. Kaza serves as the base for excursions in the area and among others, the Ki (Key), Hikkim, Komik and Langja monasteries are at hand.
  <br><br>
    <b>Gette:</b> This is the highest village in Spiti and is situated at a height of 4,270 m.
  <br><br>
    <b>Lingti Valley:</b> Through a deep gorge, the Lingti stream, another one of the Spiti's tributaries, flows down from the north. The valley offers some strenuous treks.
