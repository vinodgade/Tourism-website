  <b>Kasauli:</b> Located at 1,927 metres above sea level is a quaint little town Kasauli that seems to exist in a time wrapped in an era that reminds of the 19th century. Its colonial ambience is reinforced by cobbled paths, quaint shops, gabled houses with charming facades and scores of neat little gardens and orchards. Kasauli is surrounded by a mixed forest of chir-pine, Himalyan oak and huge horse-chestnuts. Its narrow road slithers up and down the hillsides and offer some magnificent vistas. You can get vantage views from Monkey Point, 4 Km from the bus stand. The town takes its name from the village of Kasol that has since merged with the fringes of the town.

  <b>Kuthar Fort:</b>  Within a short driving distance of both Arki and Subathu - and barely an hour away from the Jubbarhatti (Shimla) airport - is the fort of Kuthar. Its oldest sections are 800 years old while the most recent structures are barely eight decades old. This is spread over a large area and fresh-water springs flow within its confines. Close-by are several scenic attractions like Kunihar, the Gurkha fort of Subathu and the hill station of Kasauli.

  <b>Arki Fort:</b>  Once the capital of the princely state of Baghal, Arki has witnessed a good measure of turbulence in this area. Arki became the stronghold of an invading force of Gurkhas during the 'Gurkha Wars' that came to an end in 1815-16. About 1850, Raja Kishen Chand had the fort decorated with fine murals executed in the Pahari style. Here is a place packed with history and adored with fine art.

These have been exhaustively renovated and are now a quality heritage resort.
