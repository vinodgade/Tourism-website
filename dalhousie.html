  <p>
    <b>Subhash Baoli -</b>Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose spent a large portion of 1937 contemplating here. A nice secluded place.
<br><br>

    <b>Panjpulla - </b> It means five bridges. It is a picturesque spot with water flowing under the five small bridges. A Samadhi of Sardar Ajit Singh, uncle of Bhagat Singh, adds to its importance. A small fresh water spring Satdhara is close by.
<br><br>

    <b>Bakrota hills -</b> Visit for a brisk walk round the hills and have a view of snow clad peaks. It is 5 Km from Dalhousie.
<br><br>

    <b>Kalatope - </b>It is a picnic spot and a wild life sanctuary, 10 Km from Dalhousie and offers a fine view of the countryside.
<br><br>

    <b>Bara Pathar</b> It is 4 Km from Dalhousie enroute Kalatope. In village Ahla here, there is a temple of Bhulwani Mata.
<br><br>

    <b>Dainkund -</b> It is 10 Km from Dalhousie. On a clear day this tall peak (2745 m) affords a birdâ€™s eye-view of the hills, verdant valleys and the Beas, Ravi and Chenab Rivers threading their silvery passage down to the plains.
<br><br>

     <b>Chattradi -</b> The temple of Chattradi is regarded as one of the holiest ones competing with well known temples of "Lakshna Devi" at Bharmour and of "Bhawani" at Kangra. Some of its idols are believed to have been brought from far South or the State of Orissa.
<br>
    According to the inscription at Chattradi the temple was built by Raja Meru Varman, by whose order the inscription was engraved along with the names of his father, grandfather and great grandfather as well as that of the sculptor. This epigraph commemorates Meru Varman's victory over his rivals with the help of the Devi.
<br>
    Chattradi looks most scenic during September and October. Even on other occasions, particularly in spring, Chattradi offers pleasant scenery.

<br><br>
    <b>Kynance - </b>Kynance is a private residential building of Dharamvirs. This building was constructed during the year 1933 by Dr. N.R.Dharamvir of Lahore. This building acquired historical significance due to the reason that Neta Ji Subhash Chander Bose, a class fellow of the wife of Dr. Dharamvir, stayed with them for a period of 7 months beginning May, 1937. Before arriving in Dalhousie, Neta Ji was in British Jail where his health had deteriorated. On the request of his younger brother the British High Court released Neta Ji on parole on health grounds. It brought Neta Ji to the climate of Dalhousie. Kynance is barely 50 Km from G.P.O. It lies hidden from the public eye below the road. An insignificant looking board bearing the name of Kynance hangs from a tree and is discernible to only those tourists who have an eye for details.
<br><br>
